# NONAXX-calculator
can perform 6 basic logical operations
# NONAXX is not your typical calculator. It doesn’t compute numbers—it explores logic.

# What is it?
A 4-bit Arduino-based calculator that performs six fundamental logic operations: NOR, OR, NAND, AND, XOR, XNOR.
Binary inputs and outputs are visualized using LEDs—OFF and ON states replace zeros and ones.
The name “NONAXX” is derived from the first letters of the logic operations it supports.

# Why build it?
To explore how we intuitively process logic and translate that into structured, programmable thinking.
To experiment with implementing mental models directly in code.
To push the boundaries of basic electronics and programming by integrating them with a thoughtful design process.

# What makes it interesting?
Instead of solving arithmetic problems, it replicates the logic behind them.
Code structure is designed around human reasoning patterns, not just syntax.
Reusable bitwise functions reflect the way we might solve these problems by hand.
Built-in debugging methods reduce complex testing to just a few blocks of code.

# What can you expect?
A creative approach to logic gates using C++ on Arduino.
A circuit layout that is efficient, readable, and beginner-friendly.
Commentary that explains not just how the code works, but why it was written that way.

# Curious?
Want to know how arrays can rewrite themselves mid-function?
